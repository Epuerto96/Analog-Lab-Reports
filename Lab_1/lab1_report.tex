\section{Abstract}

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to refresh skills learned from both circuits 1 and 2. Through the use of Multi-Sim and our lab bench equipment we will calculate and graph the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter.


\section{Theory}
\label{sec:desigan_and_analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:lab1_circuit} shows the circuit that will be constructed during this experimentation. Through the use of the function generator we will be able input an AC voltage at $V_i$. Using the oscilloscope we can measure the output voltage across the capacitor. From that we can derive our amplitude measurements.

\section{Experiment}
\subsection{Experimental setup and procedure}
Using \figurename{1} as our reference for the circuit design we begin the experimentation
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First we construct the circuit ensuring to have all values correct.
	\item By varying the frequency by intervals of 100hz and taking the amplitude at each point, construct a table of all values to model frequency response
\end{enumerate}

\section{Measurements}
\subsection{Measurement Table}

From the data gathered in 3.1.2 we can construct a table.

\subsection{Graph of Measurements}

\end{figure}	

\subsection{Calculating cutoff frequency}

To calculate our cutoff frequency we will use the equation

$$\frac{1}{2\pi RC} = f_c$$

Using our Resistor Value of $1k$ and our Capacitance value of $.1uF$
we can solve for $f_c$

$$f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi (1k)(.1uF)}\approx 1600Hz$$





\subsection{Measuring Cut-off frequency}

For measuring cut-off frequency my graph of the data is inconclusive. The data I collected could have be corrupted in a number of ways including user error. From collaboration with other students I can say that a response of $1600Hz$ is reasonably accurate.
\newpage
\subsection{Calculating time constant $s$}

To calculate $s$ we will use the equation

$$\tau = RC = \frac{1}{2\pi F_c}$$

By inputing the values that are given we can calculate $\tau$

$$\tau = (1k)(.1uF) = \frac{1}{2\pi 1600Hz} = \frac{1}{10000}$$

\section{Conclusion}

In this experimentation, we used a capacitor and resistor to construct a simple low pass filter. Using this filter setup we calculated $f_c$,$\tau$, and we where able to graph the response(albeit incorrect). The function generator in combination with the oscilloscope is a powerful combination of tools for creating and mapping various filters that was essential to brush up on for this experimentation.
